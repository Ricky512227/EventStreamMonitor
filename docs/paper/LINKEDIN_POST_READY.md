After 3 years, I went back to refactor my EventStreamMonitor project.

The old architecture: Thread-per-stream model (rookie mistake)
The new architecture: Event-driven with connection pooling

What changed my mind? Understanding how connections and threads actually work under the hood.

Key realizations:
- Context switching costs more than the actual work (cache invalidation = killer)
- Python's GIL blocks CPU parallelism, NOT I/O parallelism
- Connection pools aren't optional - they're a 100x performance multiplier
- Sometimes 1 thread > 200 threads

I wrote a complete technical breakdown of everything I learned:

The real-world project showing before/after:

## Alternative Shorter Version:

```
3 years ago: Built EventStreamMonitor with thread-per-stream (200 threads, 400MB memory)
Today: Refactored to event-driven (1 thread, 100MB memory, 10x faster)

What I learned about connections, threads, and why "more threads = better" is wrong:

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### 1. Get Your Dev.to URL
- Go to your published Dev.to article
- Copy the full URL (e.g., `https://dev.to/yourusername/understanding-connections-and-threads-xxxx`)

### 2. Prepare the Post
- Open the post content above
- Replace `[PASTE YOUR DEV.TO URL HERE]` with your actual URL
- Choose which version you prefer (long or short)

### 3. Post on LinkedIn
- **Best Time**: Tuesday-Thursday, 10AM-2PM (your timezone)
- Go to LinkedIn → Click "Start a post"
- Paste your prepared content
- Add a cover image (optional but recommended):
  - Screenshot of your architecture diagram
  - Or performance metrics comparison
  - Or just skip for now
- Click "Post"

### 4. Add to Featured Section (Important!)
- Go to your LinkedIn profile
- Scroll to "Featured" section (below your About section)
- Click "+" to add
- Add your Dev.to blog post
- Add your GitHub repo (github.com/Ricky512227/EventStreamMonitor)
- This makes them visible on your profile!

### 5. Engage with Comments
- Reply to all comments within 24 hours
- Shows you're active and engaged
- Helps with LinkedIn algorithm

### 6. Follow Up (Optional)
- After 1 week, repost with engagement update:
  - "Update: X views, Y comments - thanks for the engagement!"
- Share in relevant LinkedIn groups:
  - Python Developers
  - Backend Engineering
  - Software Engineering

## Pro Tips:

1. **Add Media**: Screenshot of your architecture diagram or performance metrics makes the post more engaging

2. **First Comment**: Post a comment immediately after publishing:
   - "Happy to answer questions about the architecture or implementation details!"

3. **Cross-Post**: Share on Twitter/X if you have it (same content, different platform)

4. **Update Resume**: Add the blog post to your resume under Projects section

5. **Track Engagement**: LinkedIn shows you stats - use this to learn what works

## What Success Looks Like:

- ✅ 100+ views in first 24 hours
- ✅ 10+ comments/discussions
- ✅ People asking technical questions
- ✅ Requests to connect from other engineers
- ✅ Shares from your network

## Remember:

- Be authentic - this is YOUR real project
- Engage genuinely with comments
- Don't be discouraged by low initial engagement
- Consistency matters more than one viral post
