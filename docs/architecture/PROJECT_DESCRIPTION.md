# EventStreamMonitor - Project Description ## What is EventStreamMonitor? **EventStreamMonitor** is a production-ready, real-time microservices monitoring platform that collects, streams, and visualizes application logs and errors across multiple services in real-time. ## Core Purpose The project demonstrates modern DevOps practices by providing: - **Real-time log collection** from multiple microservices - **Event streaming** using Apache Kafka - **Error monitoring and alerting** with automatic filtering - **Live dashboard** for error visualization - **Production-ready architecture** with microservices ## Key Features ### 1. Real-Time Log Streaming - Collects logs from multiple microservices simultaneously - Streams logs to Apache Kafka for processing - Automatic error level detection (ERROR, CRITICAL) - Service identification and metadata tagging ### 2. Error Monitoring & Filtering - Automatically filters ERROR and CRITICAL level logs - Stores errors for analysis and alerting - Provides statistics by service and error type - Real-time error tracking and visualization ### 3. Multi-Service Dashboard - Live dashboard showing error statistics - Real-time error feed with auto-refresh - Service-level error breakdown - Error details with timestamps, stack traces, and context ### 4. Microservices Architecture - Independent, scalable services - Event-driven communication via Kafka - Redis caching for performance - Session management across services - Database per service (isolation) - Database connection pooling optimized for high throughput - Gunicorn-based deployment with multi-worker, multi-threaded configuration ### 5. Production-Ready Features - Docker containerization - Gunicorn WSGI server (4 workers × 2 threads per service) - Database connection pooling (10 base + 5 overflow per worker) - Optimized for 1000-2000 requests/second per instance - Health checks and monitoring - Grafana integration ready - RESTful APIs for automation - Comprehensive error handling ## Tech Stack - **Backend**: Python, Flask - **WSGI Server**: Gunicorn (4 workers × 2 threads) - **Message Broker**: Apache Kafka - **Cache/Sessions**: Redis - **Databases**: PostgreSQL (per service, with connection pooling) - **Connection Pooling**: SQLAlchemy QueuePool - **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose - **Monitoring**: Custom Dashboard, Grafana-ready - **API**: RESTful APIs - **Performance**: Optimized for 1000-2000 req/sec per service instance ## Architecture Overview ``` Microservices (User, Task, Notification, etc.) - Generate logs and events - Stream to Kafka Kafka Topics Apache Kafka - application-logs - application-logs-errors Consumer filters errors Log Monitor Service - Error filtering - Error storage - API endpoints Dashboard Grafana (Web UI) Integration ``` ## Use Cases ### 1. **DevOps Monitoring** - Monitor multiple microservices from one dashboard - Track errors in real-time - Identify problematic services quickly - Set up alerts for critical errors ### 2. **Development & Debugging** - Real-time error visibility - Service-level error tracking - Error context and stack traces - Historical error analysis ### 3. **Production Monitoring** - Production error monitoring - Service health tracking - Performance insights - Grafana dashboards for operations ### 4. **Learning & Portfolio** - Demonstrates microservices architecture - Shows Kafka event streaming - Redis caching patterns - Docker containerization - Real-time monitoring systems ## What Makes It Stand Out ### For Recruiters/Employers: - **DevOps Skills**: Real-time monitoring, log aggregation - **Microservices**: Scalable, distributed architecture - **Event-Driven**: Kafka for event streaming - **Production Ready**: Docker, health checks, error handling - **Modern Stack**: Kafka, Redis, Python, Flask - **Full-Stack**: Backend APIs + Dashboard UI ### Technical Highlights: - Real-time processing with Kafka - Scalable microservices architecture - High-performance configuration (1000-2000 req/sec) - Database connection pooling for optimal performance - Multi-worker, multi-threaded Gunicorn deployment - Caching and session management - Error filtering and alerting - Dashboard visualization - Grafana integration ready ## Project Structure ``` EventStreamMonitor/ services/ # Microservices usermanagement/ # User service taskprocessing/ # Task processing service (handles task management) notification/ # Notification service logmonitor/ # Log monitoring service common/ # Shared libraries infrastructure/ # Docker, K8s configs docs/ # Documentation scripts/ # Utility scripts ``` ## Quick Start ```bash # Start all services docker-compose up -d # Access dashboard open http://localhost:5004 # Stream test errors python3 scripts/quick_stream_errors.py ``` ## Perfect For - **First GitHub Project**: Professional, complete, showcases skills - **Portfolio Project**: Demonstrates real-world DevOps practices - **Learning Project**: Covers microservices, Kafka, monitoring - **Interview Project**: Shows system design and architecture skills ## Value Proposition **EventStreamMonitor** demonstrates your ability to: 1. Build production-ready microservices 2. Implement real-time monitoring systems 3. Work with modern DevOps tools (Kafka, Redis, Docker) 4. Create scalable, event-driven architectures 5. Build monitoring and observability tools This is exactly what recruiters look for - practical, production-ready code that solves real problems!
